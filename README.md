# Crypto-Chat
CryptoChat is designed to be a discrete messaging service that uses asymmetric cryptography 
to securely send messages to your friends or business partners. Written in Java. Privacy on the internet is very 
important and CryptoChat is the best way to make sure your messages arenâ€™t read by third parties 
including:

* Third Party Advertisements 
* Government Officials
* Friends or Family who intrude on your business


## Asymmetric Cryptography:
Asymmetric Cryptography is a type of encryption in which a user gets their own private key/public
key pair to decrypt/encrypt messages. 

  * Example: Bob uses Alice's public key to encrypt his message for Alice. Then, Alice uses her own private
  key to decrypt the message sent by bob.
